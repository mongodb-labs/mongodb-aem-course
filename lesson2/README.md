# Lesson 2
Over the course of this lesson we will be focussing on the following aspects
- Understand the different data formats that AEM stores in MongoDB
- Internal data structure
- Introduction to MongoDB
- How to configure MongoDB

## Lesson repository structure
For this lesson we will be using 2 vagrant instances
- mongodb instance: virtual machine that where we will be installing a standalone MongoDB instance
- aem instance: here we will be installing the AEM and connecting that to MongoDB instance

Do not forget that for a correct installation and operation of *aem* instances you need to have a copy and license of your AEM 6.0 or 6.1 in the _AEM/author_ folder
